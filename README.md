## 🛠️ How I Built It (Step-by-Step)

1. **Planned the data structure** — Chose a list of dictionaries to manage employee records.
2. **Designed core functions** for each operation: Add, Update, Delete, List.
3. **Handled edge cases** like duplicate employee IDs and empty data lists.
4. **Created a menu-driven system** with a while loop for user interaction.
5. **Formatted output** using string formatting and optionally the `tabulate` module.
